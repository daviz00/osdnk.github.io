    The tenderness that has become an important character in my thoughts very suddenly is not possible to define dictionaries in a proper way, because by their nature they unbelievably want to include every meaning in several synonyms, as if it were to exhaust anything, they do not want to be defined by a short description. For there are things that require a broader form of expression.
    </p>
    <p>
    Gestures are the most basic form of giving multidimensionality to words and their meanings. The same role is played by music, where the multitude of tones ignites the emotionality of words that begin to add to the real story. In any case, truthfulness is a relative issue here. Finally, there are things whose definition needs to be enriched with people and history. Tenderness seems to be one of them, but the story itself is far too little. Such a story should be co-experienced, permeated with one's own emotions and feelings to finally convey the meaning of that tenderness. The experience of a foreign world, which, although it may be called fictional, is indeed true by being brought to life by itself, can be such an experience.
    </p>
    <p>
    Nor is it an experience that everyone faces in the same way, since this form of life is not available to everyone. A certain necessity is something that can be called tenderness. However, tenderness cannot be achieved through literary experience. Words have the power to name things that have been created in us before. A word precedes and follows something that exists between. However, the word is not really that. This gap is what you can try to surround with words very densely, but even then it will be significantly different from them. This precision of words may be a certain channel of communication, but it is only a figure whose true reality must already be in the listener and recipient.
    </p>
    <p>
    Hence the conclusion that in order to determine tenderness, it would be necessary to experience it, which makes this activity unique, because each experience is so deeply different that any two will find more dissimilarities than similarities at a sufficiently deep level of the dissection of emotions into their components. So tenderness has no universal definition, which makes it even more mysterious.
    </p>

    Thus every attempt to describe it can be described as an invitation to get closer and to learn tenderness from each other. In this way closeness is no longer just common knowledge, but a common particle of the mind, which is no longer completely free. This is a rather firm denial of the egoism that deeply permeates our existence. The separation from the "I" here is not an attempt to annihilate one's own individuality, but a struggle for a larger and fuller self, whose life is not limited by body or time. It is the same as with the body that is only seemingly ours. In fact, his individuality is denied every day by the metabolism that converts our cells into others. Why would the mind be exempt from this process? What makes it more selfish about the rest of the human being, who has no problem with constant giving and taking?
    </p>
    <p>
    It seems that we are living in a time when this invitation is unavailable to everyone because of the evil that surrounds us and offers a clich√©, that is to say, phantom words that do not even try to grasp the right gap. We ask questions and do not ask at all, we say words that have no content. To reach the meanings is demanding because it often requires compromises, i.e. precisely the metabolism of the mind, where its cells are replaced with others. Therefore, not sharing the meanings leads to terrible consequences, because tenderness loses its meaning, and our mind, or soul, dies because of the lack of life-giving processes.

    The soul can be understood as if it wants to be spared in the process of changeability and preserved for a better time. Changeability is what terrifies and forces us to take a stand against it. Religion is one of them because it enters into polemics with her and undermines her arguments. Her children hope that there is something else underneath the lining of changeability, and this can probably be considered the foundation of virtually any religion. The fight for unchangeability, fullness and unity is the common denominator of every belief. Another position is the acceptance of changeability, fluidity and permeability of everything. Such affirmation of changeability, not necessarily radical, is an effort for immortality. Relativity gives space to create unity and transitoriness, and thus duration despite space and time constraints. This space can become a meeting place for believers and non-believers, who in different ways want to overcome the limitations of matter.
    </p>

    The world that surrounds us seems to be losing something that can be defined by its sensitivity to subtlety. We lose the ability to distinguish subtlety in the meanings of words, and by doing so we lose all the richness of meanings between synonymous lexems, which, however, often turn out to be radically different. We can say that we are experiencing a deep crisis of greyness, when we lose tenderness in discerning the truth and our meanings become fragile and petty. Today we often declare our relationship, not love. We declare infatuation, not closeness. Seemingly similar words turn out to be powerfully different when we look at them with tenderness and attention. Time, attention, and patience are the enemies of modern times. Our relations meet with the defeat of the harvest, when we are in an apparent multitude, killing hunger for tenderness and delicacy.

    Tenderness can also be called an art form. The creation of precise images from the particles of feelings is a complicated task. Artefacts are created by listening and experiencing, but the artist is not passive here, and he gives his corrections to the played objects. The artist's personality can be more or less creative, hence the same object is given different, unlike each other, characteristics. This is how it works to get to know each other when the "I" mixes with the "you" and you do not know what and where it was before.
    </p>
    <p>
    The special task is to reverse this process and create an artifact in an unconventional way, i.e. without knowing the object. Creating the object of a work of art is an inch of art, when tenderness creates poetry, gives it words and allows it to be processed.
